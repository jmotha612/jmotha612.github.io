My name is Joshua Motha and I am 13 years old. I am a rising 8th grader and I go to Alston Ridge Middle School. I love to play and watch sports because I just feel like watching and playing sports is the absolute best thing to do. My favorite sport is basketball and I have been playing this sport for about 7-8 years. I plan to get better every time I step onto the court. One of my major goals in life is to become an NBA player. Some achievements in my life are being a great basketball player, being someone who studies hard and gets good grades, and also, someone who knows a lot about sports. A fun fact about me that many people don't know is that even though I am basically a teenager, I still sleep with 2 stuffed animals.
