My name is Joshua Motha and as of Wednesday, May 27, 2020, I am 12 years old. I went to Green Hope Elementary school, and when I reached Middle School, I went to West Cary for 6th grade. Now, I go to Alston Ridge Middle School. I plan to stay in Alston Ridge Middle School for 8th grade as well and then, after 8th grade, my plan is to go to Panther Creek High School until I reach college, obviously.  I love to play and watch sports because I just feel like watching and playing sports is the absolute best thing to do. I love playing basketball, I have been playing for about 7-8 years, and I plan to get better every time I step onto the court. One of my major goals in life is to become an NBA player. However, if I cannot become an NBA player, then I don't know yet what I will do. Some achievements in my life are being a great basketball player, being someone who studies hard and gets good grades, and also, someone who knows a lot about sports. A weird fact about me that many people don't know about me is that even though I am basically a teenager, I still sleep with 2 stuffed animals. I don't care what anyone has to say about that. My stuffed animals are precious to me and I will always keep them (until I go to college, probably).
